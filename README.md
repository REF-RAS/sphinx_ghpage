This repository is an example of a building a documentation website for a Github repository as well as a template for adapting to other projects. The documentation website is hosted on Github Pages so that source code management, documentation, and web publishing can be managed on a single platform.

Please refer to the [Tutorial](./docs/source/README.md) page on how to setup such a website easily.
